#### 12th VIVO Conference 2021 dedicated to the memory of Graham Triggs 

Graham Triggs passed away on May 25th 2021. With Graham, we lost an outstanding member of the VIVO Community. He was a VIVO Committer for many years, a skilled software developer, and as an outspoken open-source advocate. 
A memorial note will be held during the conference to give all who knew and appreciated him an opportunity to remember him. Please see the conference program for details. We invite all those who will miss Graham - from the VIVO Community and beyond - to join. The memorial note will be held by Michael Conlon.

Then on Friday 6:40 PM, we will leave the conference room open to gather together and remember Graham. Bring your favorite stories of Graham, and a beer, preferably an IPA.
